# Begin with HIPP MPI

## Hello World Example

{% hint style="info" %}
In the following we assume you have already known the basic ideas of MPI, such as the initialization of MPI environment, the basic point-to-point communication. If you a new to MPI, this tutorial is not suitable for you. We recommend you to learn at least the basic ideas of how to use MPI. Some tutorial material can be found at the [MPI Tutorial](https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/).

We also assume that you have already install successfully the HIPP with MPI library enabled. If  not, please see the the [home page](../../) for how to install HIPP with MPI option.
{% endhint %}

We begin with the 'hello world' example as a demonstration of how to use HIPP MPI. \[see source code\]

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
